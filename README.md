# CSSS FROSH Week Site

To work on a new Frosh week site for a new year  
 1. create a new folder in archive to store the code used for last year's site. Follow the convention of folder naming already in the archive folder [e.g. "frosh\<year\>"]  
 2. copy the following folders/files into the folder you just created in the archive folder:  
		mainsite  
		assets  
		index.html  
 3. Now you can work on the live site with the files index.html and mainsite/frosh.html  
  
The google drive documents that have been used to plan frosh are located here: [https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B3DzwBe8wwp2fmI0bE83cDhkSUVBQXlGNElLNnpjbzNlc3RuNm94eG9keDN6THkxeEJxV1U](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B3DzwBe8wwp2fmI0bE83cDhkSUVBQXlGNElLNnpjbzNlc3RuNm94eG9keDN6THkxeEJxV1U)
