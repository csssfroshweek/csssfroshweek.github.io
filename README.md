# CSSS FROSH Week Site

To work on a new Frosh week site for a new year  
 1. create a new folder in archive to store the code used for last year's site. Follow the convention of folder naming already in the archive folder [e.g. "frosh\<year\>"]  
 2. copy the following folders/files into the folder you just created in the archive folder:  
		mainsite  
		assets  
		index.html  
 3. Now you will also need to take the archive folder you just created and copy it over to the archive repository on the main CSSS froshweek-archive-repo, located [here](https://github.com/CSSS/froshweek-site-archives)
 3. Now you can work on the live site with the files index.html and mainsite/frosh.html
