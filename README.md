# CSSS FROSH Week Site

To work on a new Frosh week site for a new year  
 1. create a new folder in archive to store the code used for last year's site. Follow the convention of folder naming already in the archive folder [e.g. "frosh\<year\>"]  
 2. copy the following folders/files into the folder you just created in the archive folder:  
		mainsite  
		assets  
		index.html  
		FROSH_COMMITEE.md
 3. Now you can work on the live site with the files index.html and mainsite/frosh.html. Be sure to also update FROSH_COMMITTEE.md with the current frosh commitee to leave a track of the people working on Frosh for future reference  
  
The google drive documents that have been used to plan frosh are located on the official CSSS Google Drive. To access them please send a request email to the Systems Administrator at csss-webmaster@sfu.ca
